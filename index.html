  <h1>Manav Moudgil</h1>
  <p><em>Founder and CEO of this <strong>Created Website</strong></em></p>
  <p>I am a 12 year old kid who is trying to learn all about Web Development and
  the basics of it. I am here to learn all about Java Script and all that fun
  stuff that is involved with it. My favorite drink is a shirley temple and I
  have a really big, loving, and supporting family. I'm so thankful for my parents
  and everything they have done for me and one day I hope to repay them. This is
gonna be about the trip my family and I took to Seattle and the fun things we did
there.</p>
